Hi Lead Funnels.

Our CRM all email templates needs to be revised and make them for device responsive. Eg. Attached one email, in Desktop it's looking fine and mobile too. but other emails are narrow in desktop. 

Also have one version Reverse CTA  for Paid Client. 


1. Pepagora paying for these ads - Add cross CTA in it.
2. Seller paying for those ads from their side. - Let's remove that. because that may create problem .
